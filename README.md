Fish Fury is an action fishing AR game for Android! Set up your pond and reel up fish from ripples in the water. Watch out though! Once you reel them in, they fight back! Mash the screen as fast as possible to knock that fish’s lights out. View your collection in the aquarium, or keep fishing n’ punching away!
